Read me:

This program is being designed for investigators that do not have time
to memorize every single cryptocurrency address and character length.
At any given time, there are over 2,000 active cryptocurrencies and it
will significatly help investigators understand which cryptocurrency
they are investigating.

Unfortunately, due to the inherent protocols that cryptocurrencies are
designed with, many of them will begin with the same characters and have
the same character length. I am hoping to develop a program that will help
alleviate the issue of identifying this with this all inclusive program as well.

I am looking for help developing this. As this is my first project, I code
rather slow and need time to learn and understand how to better the flow
of my code as I go. Please contact me at ktpoorman@ua.edu if you would 
like to help me.
